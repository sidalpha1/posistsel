This file contains the code to implement the problem given to us.
there are a  few things to be noted here in the given program.
1.The condition must always be followed that the root must be greater than the child node which means we need to implement a max heap.
2.The address conditions makes us to follow that every node must know the address of the genesis node.
3.A hash value will be calculated on the basis of the parameneters given to us.
